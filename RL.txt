Dear Latha,

Please accept this letter as formal notification that I am resigning from my position as Account Executive with Marketing Media. My last day will be Thursday, March 2.

Thank you so much for the opportunity to work in this position for the past six years. I’ve greatly enjoyed and appreciated the opportunities I’ve had to grow our sales team and pipeline, be a part of creating a great product, and work with my fellow colleagues, and I’ve learned so much about marketing strategy and the digital media space, which I will certainly take with me throughout my career.

I’ll do everything possible to wrap up my duties and train other team members over the next two weeks. Please let me know if there’s anything else I can do to help during this transition.

If I can do anything to help with your transition in finding and training my replacement, please let me know.

I wish the company continued success, and I hope to stay in touch in the future.

Thanks,
Hari Ch
