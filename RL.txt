Dear Latha,

Please accept this letter as formal notification that I am resigning from my position as Member Technical with Broadridge Financial Solutions. My last day will be Friday, May 21.

Thank you so much for the opportunity to work in this position for the past two years. I’ve greatly enjoyed and appreciated the opportunities I’ve had to grow our Transfer Agency team and pipeline, be a part of creating a great products, and work with my fellow colleagues, and I’ve learned so much about Technologies and the Work culture, which I will certainly take with me throughout my career.

I’ll do everything possible to wrap up my duties over the next three months. Please let me know if there’s anything else I can do to help during this transition.

I wish the company continued success, and I hope to stay in touch in the future.

Thanks,
Hari Ch
